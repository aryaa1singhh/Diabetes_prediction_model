# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on clinical and demographic data. Several machine learning models were implemented and compared to evaluate their performance. The goal is to provide an accessible tool for early diabetes risk assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes features such as:
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Age
- Insulin levels
- Pregnancies
- Skin Thicknes
- Diabetes Pedigree Function

## Models Implemented
Three machine learning algorithms were tested:

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Support Vector Classifier (SVC) | 77.27% |
| Logistic Regression | 75.94% |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 77.27% |

**Observations:**  
- Both SVC and Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy of 77.27%.  
- Logistic Regression also performed well at 75.94%.  
- Nonlinear models like SVC and Decision Trees slightly outperform linear models on this dataset.
